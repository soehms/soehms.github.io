# Sebastian Oehms

This page is about my open source code contributions, focused on [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org). This work is not related to my employment at [S&P Computersysteme](https://en.sup-logistik.de). So these contributions were created in my free time mainly on subway and bus rides to and from my office.
