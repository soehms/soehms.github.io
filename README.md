# Sebastian Oehms

This page is about my open source code contributions, focused on [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org). This work is not related to my employment at [S&P Computersysteme](https://en.sup-logistik.de). So these contributions were created in my free time mainly on subway and bus rides to and from my office.


## Contributions to SageMath

* [Cubic Braid Groups](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/groups/sage/groups/cubic_braid.html) (released [9.0](https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.0))
* [Localization](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/rings/sage/rings/localization.html) (released [9.1](https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.1))
* [Splitting Algebras](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/algebras/sage/algebras/splitting_algebra.html) (released [9.2](https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.2))

* [Links-Gould Invariant](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/knots/sage/knots/link.html#sage.knots.link.Link.links_gould_polynomial) (released [9.7](https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.7))



Furthermore I have been involved in the development of a couple of other features, functionalities and bug-fixes. To view them all [click here](https://trac.sagemath.org/search?q=soehms&noquickjump=1&ticket=on).

## Contributions to SageMath in progress

* [More KnotInfo wrappers for polynomial invariants](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33969)
* [New doctest option *hide features*](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/34185)
