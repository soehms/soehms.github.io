<strong>Abstract:</strong><p>

A <em>q</em>-analogue version of <em>Schur algebras</em> has been introduced
by <em>R. Dipper</em> and <em>G. James</em> 
in connection with the representation
theory of finite general linear groups. In recent work of <em>Dipper</em>,
<em>James</em> and <em>A. Matthas</em> 
this theory has been extended to other
<em>groups of Lie type</em> substituting <em>Hecke algebras</em> of 
type <em>A</em> by <em>Ariki-Koike
algebras</em> leading to so called <em>Cyclotomic q-Schur algebras</em>. 
On the other hand
the original <em>q</em>-Schur algebra can be obtained (up to Morita
equivalence) using constructions from the theory of <em>quantum groups</em>.
In this paper we apply these constructions to 
<em>q</em>-Schur algebras being related to the <em>symplectic groups</em>. These
algebras
appear in general as centralizer algebras of the
<em>Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebras</em> on tensor spaces.
Setting
the deformation parameter <em>q</em> to 1, we obtain classical symplectic
Schur algebras in the sense of <em>S. Donkin</em>.</p> 

The main result in this paper is that symplectic
<em>q</em>-Schur algebras are <em>cellular</em> in the sense 
of <em>J. Graham</em> and
<em>G. Lehrer</em> and  <em>integrally quasi-hereditary</em>
as algebras over the ring of integer Laurent polynomials.
A cellular basis is realized via a quantum symplectic version
of <em>bideterminants</em>. While in the authors paper on
Centralizer Coalgebras, FRT-Construction and Symplectic Monoids
a symplectic version of
the <em>straightening formula</em> for bideterminants
has been presented in the classical case,
we will give a quantized version of that
formula, here.<p>
