<strong>Abstract:</strong><p>
Using a construction by Faddeev, Reshetikhin
	and Takhtadjian (1990) together with some additional relations
	we obtain a quantization of the
coordinate ring of the symplectic monoid. The latter is defined
as the Zariski-closure of the group of symplectic similitudes inside
	the monoid of <em>n</em> by <em>n</em> matrices. It has 
been considered by Grigor'ev (1981) and Doty (1996), too.
We define <em>symplectic q-Schur algebras</em> as the dual
	algebras
to the homogeneous summands of these quantized coordinate rings. In the
classical specialization one obtains the symplectic Schur algebras
defined by Donkin (1987). We define a quantum symplectic version
of <em>bideterminants</em> and prove an analogue to the well known
<em>straightening formula</em>. This yields cellular bases (in the
	sense of Graham and Lehrer) for these
q-Schur algebras. Furthermore the criterion for quasi-heriditaryness
of a cellular algebra is checked to hold. It is easy to see, that the
symplectic q-Schur algebras are the centralizer algebras of the
<em>Birman-Murakami-Wenzl</em> algebras in the generic case (over
the rational function field in <em>q</em>). We show that the same is true
for other specializations, at least if <em>q</em> 
is not a certain root of unity.
Finally we are able to improve
some results of Doty concerning the classical symplectic Schur algebras
 over a field of
characteristic zero, to fields of arbitrary characteristic.<p>

<strong>Remark:</strong><p>
A brief survey of the main results of the thesis can be found
in the manusscript of a <a href="jena.html">talk</a> I held in
	Jena in May 1996.
As the manusscript of the thesis it is in German. I started to produce two
preprints of the material in English.
For two years I hadn't got any time to continue
working on them. But now the 
first one is ready for submission, whereas the
second one is still under correction.
Nevertheless you may download postscriptfiles of these
two manuscripts:<p>

The
<a href="frt.html"> first paper </a> contains 
material I presented at a
<a href="oberfl.html"> workshop in Oberflockenbach </a>. In addition it contains
a proof of the straightening formular for symplectic monoids in the classical case. The
procedure is different from that given in the thesis (adapted to this easier case
and thus much clearer).<p> 

The <a href="symp.html"> second paper </a>  
contains a proof of the straightening formular for <em>quantum</em> 
symplectic monoids. The procedure is as well
different from that given in the thesis. It is more like the treatment
in the first paper. The aim of the paper is the main result of the thesis, that
symplectic q-Schur-algebras a cellular and quasi-heriditary.
