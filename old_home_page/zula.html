<strong>Abstract:</strong><p>
The investigation of quartic surfaces possessing a one dimensional
algebraic family of conics was started by <em>E. Kummer</em>
in 1865. He described all types of such surfaces except two of them.
These two missing types the singular loci of which consist just of isolated
singularities
have been found by <em>C.M. Jessop</em> (1916)
and  <em>W.F. Meyer</em> (1921-34) respectively. On the one hand
in none of these works the completeness of the given classification is
claimed. On the other hand, for some of the types the family of conics
degenerates to a family of pairs of straight lines. Moreover, there are
surfaces in their lists which don't contain any irreducible  conic at all.
In this work the completeness of the list given by W.F. Meyer is shown.
Furthermore the surfaces possessing a family of irreducible conics
are singled out. In some cases all families of conics and in some cases all
conics are determined.<p>
